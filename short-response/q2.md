# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer
Not providing a dependency array would make it so that the useEffect hook will make a fetch request each time the component refreshes. Providing an empty array would make it so that the useEffect hook will make a fetch request during the initial render. Providing a dependency array with elements makes it so that every time one of the values in the array changes useEffect will make a fetch request.
